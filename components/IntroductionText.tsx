          This is an information hub website that Computer Science students at UCLL have created. It serves the purpose of helping people with daily tasks on most common devices like a computer and phone. The content was intended to be written simple as clear and that applies also to the website itself. The site will get improved with each new generation of students and maybe one day starts fulfilling it's purpose. Happy browsing!
